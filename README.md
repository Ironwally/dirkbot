The bot is implemented using the library [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org)

## Features
### 1. dirksay and its variations
**Syntax**: `/dirksay input:your_input` <br>
Generates ASCII art inspired by cowsay but subsituting the cow for Dirk. The commands `/nilssay` and `/sinzsay` do the same thing, but with other ASCII arts.

### 2. koeri
**Syntax**: `/koeri optional_input:your_input` <br>
Randomly generates a combination of 6 differnt curry spices to enjoy on your kœriwurst. There is the option to enter a name, to receive a recommendation for someone else.

### 3. checkoeri
**Syntax**: `/checkoeri` <br>
Checks if the kœriwerk in the Moltke Dining Hall in Karlsruhe is opened or not.

### 4. heikosschwamm
**Syntax**: `/heikosschwamm input:integer` <br>
Deletes the last n messages in the current discord channel. A little gimmick of watering, wiping out the messages and letting it dry, is also in there.

### 5. bloat
**Syntax**: `/bloat optional_input:integer` <br>
Counts how many times we have said "bloat" by adding either 1 or the specified number to the previous amount.

### 6. test
**Syntax**: `/test` <br>
Can be used to test if the bot is working correctly.

### 7. reactions
Special functions, which let dirk react to different substrings with different messages.
